# CER-Site
Private Website for Research Purposes

I've made some cool projects and I want to share them with the world. I'm also learning how to use GitHub, and to code with HTML, PHP, JS and CSS so this is a good way to practice.

I also use it for school projects, so I can share them with my classmates and teachers.

(Btw, I had a GitHub Pages active, but due to some functions only working on apache servers, I don't know how to make github host that, so currently, clone to own Apache server for it to work (: )
