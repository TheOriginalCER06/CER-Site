# CER-Site
Private Website for Research Purposes

I've made some cool projects and I want to share them with the world. I'm also learning how to use GitHub, and to code with HTML, PHP, JS and CSS so this is a good way to practice.

I also use it for school projects, so I can share them with my classmates and teachers.
